## Domain Context and Terminology

**Overall Purpose:** Our goal is to make expense reporting effortless for everyone—whether you're running a small startup or a large enterprise. We are moving beyond the headache of manual spreadsheets and endless forms to build a smart, automated platform that handles the rules for you, making the whole process truly frictionless.

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Automate Workflow:** Reduce human intervention in the submission and reconciliation loop.  
2. **Reduce Friction:** Eliminate the "pain" of filling out complex forms (like BHLC) for employees.  
3. **Scalability:** Ensure the platform works for companies with flat hierarchies (Startups) and complex hierarchies (MNCs).

**Key Domain Terms:**

| Term | Meaning as explained by the expert |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Expense/Fund** | A formal financial claim submitted by an employee for the reimbursement of business-related costs (e.g., travel, software), which is subject to policy validation and approval. |
| **Payment Gateway** | The external banking interface or API responsible for executing the actual fund transfer from the corporate wallet to the beneficiary's account upon system authorization. |
| **Audit Logs** | An immutable, chronological record of all system events (approvals, data changes, logins) used to track accountability, detect fraud, and ensure regulatory compliance. |
| **Management** | The operational layer where supervisory roles (Managers) review and validate expense claims to ensure they align with business necessities before financial processing. |
| **Reconciliation** | The automated or manual process of cross-referencing internal expense records against the external **Transaction Proof** to ensure financial accuracy and identify discrepancies. |
| **Compliance** | The strict adherence to organizational policies and legal regulations, enforced by the system through automated rules (e.g., spending limits) and regular audits. |
| **HR/Compliance Manager** | The administrative role responsible for defining expense policies, managing user roles (RBAC), and overseeing system governance. (System equivalent: **Configuration Manager**). |
| **Receipts** | Digital evidence (scanned images or PDFs) attached to an expense claim to validate the transaction's authenticity and date. Also referred to as "Expense Proof." |
| **BHLC** | **Boarding, Hoarding, and Lodging Charges**. A specific category of business expenses covering accommodation, food, and daily allowances during official travel. |
| **Transaction Proof** | The unique digital confirmation or **Transaction ID** generated by the **External Bank** after a successful payment, serving as the "source of truth" for reconciliation. |

## Actors and Responsibilities

| Actor / Role | Responsibilities |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Expense Submitter** | Authorized employee role responsible for incurring business-related costs and initiating reimbursement claims. Duties include uploading valid digital proofs (receipts) and tracking the approval status of submitted tickets. |
| **Manager** | Supervisory role responsible for the operational review of expenses. Has the authority to approve claims that meet business needs or reject them based on invalid proofs or policy violations. |
| **Financial Officer** | Specialized role focused on the monetary lifecycle. Responsible for authorizing batch payments, monitoring corporate wallet balances, and resolving discrepancies during the reconciliation process. |
| **Compliance Officer** | Oversight role dedicated to governance. Defines organizational expense policies (e.g., spending limits), reviews system audit logs for fraud detection, and ensures regulatory adherence. |
| **Configuration Manager** | Administrative persona responsible for system maintenance. Handles user provisioning (onboarding/offboarding), assigns RBAC roles, and manages global system configurations. |
| **External Bank** | Third-party system actor responsible for executing secure fund transfers via API and providing daily transaction feeds (ledger data) which serve as the "source of truth" for reconciliation. |

## Core Workflows

*Real-world scenarios identified during the discussion.*

**Workflow 1: "Startup Mode" (Direct-to-Finance)**

* **Trigger:** An employee in a small company incurs a travel expense.  
* **Steps:**  
  1. User logs in via mobile app.  
  2. User captures receipt image and selects category (e.g., Food).  
  3. **Bypass Step:** The system detects "Small Company" configuration and skips the "Reporting Manager" approval layer.  
  4. Request goes directly to the Financial Officer/HR queue.  
* **Outcome:** The company maintains speed and simplicity in expense handling, matching its flat organizational structure.

**Workflow 2: "Enterprise Mode" (Standard Hierarchy)**

* **Trigger:** An employee in a large MNC submits a high-value BHLC claim.  
* **Steps:**  
  1. User submits claim with attached invoices.  
  2. System validates amount against "Daily Allowance" policies defined by Compliance Officer.  
  3. Reporting Manager receives notification and performs operational review (Business Validity).  
  4. Financial Officer receives "Approved" claim and adds it to the Payment Batch.  
* **Outcome:** The claim is carefully reviewed at multiple levels, ensuring it is genuine, policy-compliant, and ready for reimbursement without unnecessary risk.

**Workflow 3: "Reconciliation & Error Handling"**

* **Trigger:** Financial Officer initiates a batch payment, but the bank API times out.  
* **Steps:**  
  1. System calls External Bank API.  
  2. Bank returns a "Failure" or "Pending" status.  
  3. System updates internal record to "Payment Failed."  
  4. Financial Officer triggers the "Reconciliation" module to fetch the latest Bank Feed.  
  5. System compares Bank Feed vs. Internal Logs to verify if money actually left the account.  
* **Outcome:** Issues are flagged immediately, preventing double payments or lost funds.

## Rules, Constraints, and Exceptions

**Mandatory Rules:**

* **Policy Config:** Compliance rules must be explicitly defined and enforceable. The system cannot be vague about limits (e.g., "Max ₹2000/day for food").  
* **Digital Proof:** No expense can be processed without an attached digital receipt.

**Constraints & Limitations:**

* **Banking API Fragmentation:** Integrating with legacy banks (specifically premium banks like HDFC) is difficult due to poor documentation and restricted API access.  
* **Latency:** The system must handle delays from external payment gateways without freezing the user interface.

**Exceptions & Edge Cases:**

* **Dynamic Actor Disabling:** The system must support "Layer Toggling." Small companies should be able to disable the "Manager" actor/layer entirely.  
* **Mobile responsiveness:** The submission interface must be fully functional on mobile devices to support on-the-go employees.

## Current Challenges and Pain Points

* **Integration Complexity:** Establishing direct connections with multiple banks is a major engineering hurdle.  
* **Submission Friction:** The current manual process involves filling out time-taking forms (like BHLC) and updating Excel sheets, which leads to user frustration and data entry errors.  
* **Audit Visibility:** Existing solutions present Audit Logs in messy, technical formats that are hard for non-technical Compliance Officers to read or track.

## Assumptions & Clarifications

**Confirmed Assumptions:**

* The Use Case definitions and Actor divisions (User vs. Manager vs. Finance) are accurate and align with industry standards.

**Corrected Assumptions:**

* **One Size Does Not Fit All:** We initially designed for MNCs (Multi-National Companies). The expert clarified that small startups have different needs (e.g., direct submission to HR). We must implement a "Configurable Hierarchy" feature to support this.

**Open Questions / Future Work:**

* **Aggregator Strategy:** Given the difficulty of integrating individual banks (like HDFC), should we pivot to using a Banking Aggregator (e.g., RazorpayX, Stripe Connect) for the prototype?  
* **BHLC Automation:** To what extent can information from boarding and lodging receipts be automatically extracted to reduce manual entry during expense claim submission?
